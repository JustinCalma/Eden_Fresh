note left of manager:Manager.begin() begins an endless loop calling waitForArchive()

manager->manager:waitForArchive()
note right of manager:waitForArchive() waits until 00:00:00 AM local time\non the first of the month then calls the next method.

#begin service

note right of service: Get timestamp of date 30 days ago
service->service: timestamp = getDate();

#begin querying log database
service->reader:logGateway.readLogsWhere(columnName : String, comparator : Enum, value : String)
activate reader
note right of reader:Build SQLquery with timestamp,\n  timestamp (?) = a date 30 days before from today runtime  timestamp

reader->logs:SELECT statement
activate logs

deactivate reader

#write queried logs to file
service->writer:archiveGateway.writeLogs(logs : DataTable)
activate writer
writer->archive:New .txt file
archive-->writer:Success
activate archive
note right of writer:Loop through readLogs rows. | n will be number of logs.
loop n == 0 
writer->writer: read = readLogs(n-1);
end
writer->archive:Write each iterated row of readLogs to .txt file
archive-->writer:Success
writer->archive:Compress .txt file to .zip file
note right of archive: File System acces to \nsave compress file 
archive-->writer:Success
deactivate archive

#function verification
note right of service: verify that deleteLogs matches readLogs
service->service: deleted.userid == read.userid, deleted.timestamp == read.timestamp

#perform logging
manager-->logger: logger.write(userID : int, logLevel : enum, category : enum, message : string)
