# UNSURE:
# How to compress files?
# SQL Server has a BACKUP command. Should use?
# How to add new entries to a SQL backup file?
# 	Can we save multiple backups and restore differentially a la git?
# Need to specify that the sequence is occurring at midnight of the first of the month/ whatever time?
# How to specify fitting performance NFR and other NFRs?
